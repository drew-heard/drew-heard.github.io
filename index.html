              <p class="mb-0">
             For a connected Noetherian unstable algebra \(R\) over the mod \(p\) Steenrod algebra, we prove versions of theorems of Duflot and Carlson on the depth of \(R\), originally proved when \(R\) is the mod p cohomology ring of a finite group. This recovers the aforementioned results, and also proves versions of them when \(R\) is the mod p cohomology ring of a compact Lie group, a profinite group with Noetherian cohomology, a Kac--Moody group, a discrete group of finite virtual cohomological dimension, as well as for certain other discrete groups. More generally, our results apply to certain finitely generated unstable \(R\)-modules. Moreover, we explain the results in the case of the \(p\)-local compact groups of Broto, Levi, and Oliver, as well as in the modular invariant theory of finite groups.

            <p>
                  Let \(k\) be a field with a real embedding. We compare the motivic slice filtration of a motivic spectrum over \(Spec(k)\) with the \(C_2\)-equivariant slice filtration of its equivariant Betti realization, giving conditions under which realization induces an equivalence between the associated slice towers. In particular, we show that, up to reindexing, the towers agree for all spectra obtained from localized quotients of \(MGL\) and \(MR\), and for motivic Landweber exact spectra and their realizations. As a consequence, we deduce that equivariant spectra obtained from localized quotients of \(MR\) are even in the sense of Hill--Meier, and give a computation of the slice spectral sequence converging to \(\pi_{*,*}BP\langle n \rangle/2\) for \(1 \le n \le \infty\).

        	<p>
        		The objective of this paper is to study completions and the local homology of comodules over Hopf algebroids, extending previous work of Greenlees and May in the discrete case. In particular, we relate module-theoretic to comodule-theoretic completion, construct various local homology spectral sequences, and derive a tilting-theoretic interpretation of local duality for modules. Our results translate to quasi-coherent sheaves over global quotient stacks and feed into a novel approach to the chromatic splitting conjecture.

        		<p> The first goal of this paper is to provide an abstract framework in which to formulate and study local duality in various algebraic and topological contexts. For any stable \(\infty\)-category \(\mathcal{C}\) together with a collection of compact objects \( \mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{C} \) we construct local cohomology and local homology functors satisfying an abstract version of local duality. When specialized to the derived category of a commutative ring \(A\) and a suitable ideal in \(A\), we recover the classical local duality due to Grothendieck as well as generalizations by Greenlees and May. More generally, applying our result to the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact and separated scheme \(X\) implies the local duality theorem of Alonso Tarr&iacute;o, Jerem&iacute;as L&oacute;pez, and Lipman.<br/><br/>

As a second objective, we establish local duality for quasi-coherent sheaves over many algebraic stacks, in particular those arising naturally in stable homotopy theory. After constructing an appropriate model of the derived category in terms of comodules over a Hopf algebroid, we show that, in familiar cases, the resulting local cohomology and local homology theories coincide with functors previously studied by Hovey and Strickland. Furthermore, our framework applies to global and local stable homotopy theory, in a way which is compatible with the algebraic avatars of these theories. In order to aid computability, we provide spectral sequences relating the algebraic and topological local duality contexts.</p></details></div>

<p>In this paper, we study the global structure of an algebraic avatar of the derived category of ind-coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of formal groups. In analogy with the stable homotopy category, we prove a version of the nilpotence theorem as well as the chromatic convergence theorem, and construct a generalized chromatic spectral sequence. Furthermore, we discuss analogs of the telescope conjecture and chromatic splitting conjecture in this setting, using the local duality techniques established earlier in joint work with Valenzuela.  </p>

            <p>
       We investigate the topological nilpotence degree, in the sense of Henn--Lannes--Schwartz, of a connected Noetherian unstable algebra \(R\). When \(R\) is the mod \(p\) cohomology ring of a compact Lie group, Kuhn showed how this invariant is controlled by centralizers of elementary abelian \(p\)-subgroups. By replacing centralizers of elementary abelian \(p\)-subgroups with components of Lannes' \(T\)-functor, and utilizing the techniques of unstable algebras over the Steenrod algebra, we are able to generalize Kuhn's result to more general classes of groups, such as groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension, profinite groups, and Kac--Moody groups. In fact, our results apply much more generally, for example, we establish results for \(2\)-local compact groups in the sense of Broto--Levi--Oliver, for connected \(H\)-spaces with Noetherian mod \(2\) cohomology, and for the Borel equivariant cohomology of a compact Lie group acting on a manifold at the prime 2. Along the way we establish several results of independent interest. For example, we formulate and prove a version of Carlson's depth conjecture in the case of a Noetherian unstable algebra of minimal depth.

            <p>
               We investigate when a commutative ring spectrum \(R\) satisfies a homotopical version of local Gorenstein duality, extending the absolute notion previously studied by Greenlees. In order to do this, we prove an ascent theorem for local Gorenstein duality along morphisms of \(k\)-algebras.  Our main examples are of the form \(R = C^*(X;k)\), the ring spectrum of cochains on a space \(X\) for a field \(k\). In particular, we establish local Gorenstein duality in characteristic \(p\) for \(p\)-compact groups and \(p\)-local finite groups as well as for \(k = \mathbb{Q}\) and \(X\) a simply connected space which is Gorenstein in the sense of Dwyer, Greenlees, and Iyengar.

            <p>
               Let \(X\) be a topological space with Noetherian mod p cohomology and let \(C^*(X;\mathbb{F}_p)\) be the commutative ring spectrum of \(\mathbb{F}_p\)-valued cochains on \(X\). The goal of this paper is to exhibit conditions under which the category of module spectra on \(C^*(X;\mathbb{F}_p)\) is stratified in the sense of Benson, Iyengar, Krause, providing a classification of all its localizing subcategories. We establish stratification in this sense for classifying spaces of a large class of topological groups including Kac--Moody groups as well as whenever \(X\) admits an \(H\)-space structure. More generally, using Lannes' theory we prove that stratification for \(X\) is equivalent to a condition that generalizes Chouinard's theorem for finite groups. In particular, this relates the generalized telescope conjecture in this setting to a question in unstable homotopy theory.
